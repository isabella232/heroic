/**
 * Encapsulates multiple query definitions with accompanying arithmetic query
 * definitions that pertain to those queries. For example:
 *
 * queries = {
 *
 *    "A" → { query:..., source:..., range: ... filter:... },
 *    "B" → { query:..., source:..., range: ... filter:... },
 * }

 * arithmeticQueries = { "C" → "A / B * 100" }
 * <p>
 * - you can see illustrated here that "C" pertains to the queries "A" and "B"
 * in the <code>queries</code> parameter.
 *
 * NOTE that any variables referenced in <code>arithmeticQueries</code> (in this example
 * "A" and "B", must be present as keys of the `queries` parameter.
